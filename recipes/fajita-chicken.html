     <h2>How To Cook</h2>

     <ol>
        <li>In a resealable small jar, combine all the ingredients for the seasonings. Seal and shake well. Reserve 1 1/2 teaspoons for the vegetables.</li>

        <br></br>

        <li>In a large resealable bag, combine 2 tablespoons of olive oil, lime juice and about 4 teaspoons of the fajita seasonings. Add the chicken to the bag and seal. Press the marinade into the chicken and allow to marinate while you prepare the vegetables (or chill in the refrigerator until ready to use).Slice the the onions and bell peppers.</li>

        <br></br>

        <li>Slice the the onions and bell peppers.</li>

        <br></br>

        <li>Heat 1 tablespoon olive oil in a large pan over medium-high heat. Add the onions and allow to cook for about 4-5 minutes, or until softened and fragrant. Add the bell peppers and sprinkle with the reserved 1 1/2 teaspoons of fajita seasonings. If you like the peppers with a nice crunch - cook for about 3-5 minutes. And if you like them softer, leave them on for about 3 minutes longer. Transfer and set aside on a plate.</li>

        <br></br>

        <li>Melt remaining 1 tablespoon of oil on the same skillet and brown the chicken. Cook for 5-6 minutes, or until cooked through. Add the vegetables back to the pan until heated through. Remove from heat.</li>

        <br></br>

        <li>Assemble lettuce wraps by placing a spoonful of chicken/vegetable filling into the center of each leaf. Top with avocado or your favorite toppings.</li>
